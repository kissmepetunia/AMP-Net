Extensive experiments show that the proposed AMP-Net improves the robustness of FER under occlusion and variant pose, achieving the state-of-the-art results on several in-the-wild datasets, including RAF-DB, AffectNet-7, AffectNet-8, SFEW 2.0, FER-2013, and FED-RO with accuracies of 89.25%, 64.54%, 61.74%, 61.17%, 74.48%, and 71.75%.
